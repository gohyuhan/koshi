//! Lifecycle state machines for the session model: the typed states a tab and
//! a session move through from creation to teardown.
//!
//! Each lifecycle is a small enum naming the stages a tab or a session can be
//! in: a tab is meant to be born `Creating`, become `Active` once its root
//! pane is live, and wind down through `Closing` to `Closed`; a session
//! starts `Starting`, reaches `Running` on its first tab, drops to
//! `Detaching` while no client is attached, and ends `Stopping` then
//! `Stopped`. Modelling the stages as a type turns an illegal move —
//! reviving a closed tab, stopping an already-stopped session — into a
//! transition-time error instead of a silent bug.
//!
//! [`SessionLifecycle::transition`] is the only transition function defined
//! here, and it polices the session's legal moves — see its rules below. A
//! [`Tab`](crate::session::state::Tab) currently only ever starts at
//! `TabLifecycle::Creating`; nothing in this crate yet advances it through
//! `Active`, `Inactive`, `Closing`, or sets it to `Closed` — a tab is instead
//! dropped from the session outright once it closes.
