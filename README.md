  <strong>A terminal multiplexer in Rust — split panes and tabs in one terminal window.</strong><br>
</p>

# koshi

> ⚠️ **koshi is in active development.** The author uses it as a daily driver,
> so it changes often — commands, config fields, keybindings, and defaults can
> all shift between commits. Expect that to keep being true.

## Requirements

- A terminal emulator that supports **true color** and **256 colors** (any modern one does)
- **Linux** or **macOS**; Windows is targeted but far less exercised
- **Rust 1.96+** — you build from source, there are no binaries yet

## Description

koshi is a terminal multiplexer: it runs inside one real terminal window and
gives you many independent terminals inside it. Each pane owns its own shell,
its own screen, and its own scrollback. Panes tile inside a tab, and tabs sit
inside one session.

To the terminal you launched it from, koshi is one program. To every shell it
starts, koshi *is* the terminal — it handles colors, cursor movement, and mouse
input itself, which is why programs like `vim`, `htop`, and `less` work normally
inside a pane.

## Why koshi?

koshi tries to keep its core small — tabs, panes, layout, and lock mode — and
leave the rest out of the binary. No Git panels, dashboards, or launchers
bundled in.

## Features

- 🪟 **Split Panes** — split any pane left, right, up, or down; the panes fill the tab, with no gaps left behind
- 🗂️ **Stacked Panes** — put several panes in one slot and flip between them, instead of shrinking everything
- 🔍 **Fullscreen Zoom** — blow one pane up to the whole tab and back, without losing the layout
- 📐 **Resize** — nudge a pane border one character at a time by key, or drag it with the mouse
- 📑 **Tabs** — create, close, and cycle tabs; the tab bar scrolls when it runs out of room
- ⌨️ **Multi-key Shortcuts** — chained keys (`<C-p> n`), a leader key you pick, a hint bar showing what comes next, and clash detection
- 🔒 **Lock Mode** — send every key straight to the program in the pane, so koshi's own shortcuts stop stealing them
- 🖱️ **Mouse Support** — click to focus, drag borders to resize, scroll each pane, double-click and drag to select
- 📋 **Copy to Clipboard** — select with the mouse and copy to your real clipboard, working over SSH too
- 🎯 **Mouse Select Mode** — take the mouse back from a full-screen program that is using it, so you can select text
- 📜 **Per-pane History** — each pane keeps its own scrollback and its own place in it
- 🧾 **Terminal Behavior** — true color, bold and italics, full-screen programs, wide characters like CJK and emoji, box drawing
- 🎨 **Themes** — 25 ready-made config examples included (Dracula, Gruvbox, Nord, Catppuccin, Tokyo Night, Rosé Pine, Solarized, and more)
- ⚙️ **Simple Config Files** — app settings, themes, shortcuts, and saved layouts, each in its own readable file
- 💾 **Saved Layouts** — save a set of tabs, panes, and the commands they run, then open the lot with one flag
- 🪵 **Logging** — optional log file per session, plain text or JSON, recording ids and never your content
- 🌍 **Cross-platform** — koshi targets Linux, macOS, and Windows; it is developed on macOS and CI currently builds and tests on Linux only

## Installation

> 🚧 **Coming soon.**

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gohyuhan/koshi.git
cd koshi
cargo build --release

# the binary lands here
./target/release/koshi
```

## Quick Start

Launch koshi:

```bash
koshi
```

That opens one tab with one pane running your shell in the directory where you
launched koshi. Example: `/work/demo` + `koshi` starts the first pane in
`/work/demo`.

Open a saved layout instead:

```bash
koshi --profile dev
```

### Default keybindings

The leader key is **Ctrl** by default, so the shortcuts below start with `Ctrl`
held down. Change the leader once and they all move together.

| Keys | Does |
|---|---|
| `<C-p> n` | New pane (default direction) |
| `<C-p> h` / `j` / `k` / `l` | New pane left / down / up / right |
| `<C-p> x` | Close the pane and everything it started |
| `<C-p> ←` `↓` `↑` `→` | Move focus to the neighbouring pane |
| `<C-s> ←` `↓` `↑` `→` | Move this pane's border one cell |
| `<C-t> n` | New tab |
| `<C-t> x` | Close tab |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Next / previous tab |
| `Alt+f` | Toggle fullscreen on the focused pane |
| `<C-g>` | Toggle mouse select mode |
| `<C-l>` | Lock / unlock (keys pass straight to the program) |
| `<C-q>` | Quit |

Run `koshi keys list` to see the shortcuts actually in effect, and
`koshi actions list` for everything you can bind.

Some actions ship without a default key — stacked panes, plain close-pane.
Bind them yourself in `keybinding.kdl`.

## Configuration

koshi reads four kinds of [KDL](https://kdl.dev) file, all optional. With none
of them, koshi runs on its built-in defaults.

| File | Sets |
|---|---|
| `koshi.kdl` | App settings: theme, scrollback, mouse, split direction, logging, updates |
| `themes/<name>.kdl` | Colors for borders, tab bar, and accents |
| `keybinding.kdl` | Shortcuts and the modes they live in |
| `profile/<name>.kdl` | A saved layout: tabs, panes, and the commands they run |

They live in one directory per platform:

| Platform | Config directory |
|---|---|
| Linux | `~/.config/koshi` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/koshi` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\koshi\config` |

Full reference: [config-docs/](config-docs/README.md). Ready-made themes to copy
into `themes/`: [themes-example/](themes-example/).

## CLI Reference

### Launching

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `koshi` | Start koshi with one tab and one shell pane |
| `koshi --profile <NAME>` | Start with the saved layout in `profile/<NAME>.kdl` |

### Sessions and discovery

Discovery commands accept `--format table` (default) or `--format json`.

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `koshi list-sessions` | List every running session |
| `koshi kill-session [NAME]` | End the named session, or the only running one |
| `koshi list-tabs [--session <SESSION_ID>]` | List tabs across running sessions |
| `koshi list-panes [--session <SESSION_ID>]` | List panes across running sessions |
| `koshi list-clients [--session <SESSION_ID>]` | List attached clients |
| `koshi inspect session <SESSION_ID>` | Show one session |
| `koshi inspect tab <TAB_ID>` | Show one tab |
| `koshi inspect pane <PANE_ID>` | Show one pane |
| `koshi inspect client <CLIENT_ID>` | Show one client |

### Pane and tab control

Inside koshi, omitted targets mean the current pane, tab, client, or session.
Outside koshi, name a target; with one running session, koshi may use it.

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `koshi new-pane [--direction right\|down\|left\|up] [--stacked]` | Open a shell pane |
| `koshi run [pane options] -- <COMMAND>...` | Open a pane running one command |
| `koshi close-pane [--pane <PANE_ID>] [--force]` | Close a pane |
| `koshi resize-pane --direction <DIRECTION> [--size <CELLS>]` | Move one pane border |
| `koshi focus-pane --pane <PANE_ID> [--client <CLIENT_ID>]` | Focus a pane |
| `koshi toggle-pane-fullscreen` | Toggle the focused pane's fullscreen view |
| `koshi input [--pane <PANE_ID>] [--no-enter] "<TEXT>"` | Type text into a pane |
| `koshi new-tab [--session <NAME_OR_ID>]` | Open a tab with one shell pane |
| `koshi close-tab [--tab <NAME_OR_ID>] [--force]` | Close a tab |
| `koshi next-tab [--client <CLIENT_ID>]` | Focus the next tab |
| `koshi previous-tab [--client <CLIENT_ID>]` | Focus the previous tab |
| `koshi focus-tab (--index <INDEX>\|--tab <TAB_ID>)` | Focus a tab |
| `koshi move-tab --index <INDEX> [--tab <TAB_ID>]` | Move a tab |
| `koshi lock [--client <CLIENT_ID>]` | Send keys straight to the pane |
| `koshi unlock [--client <CLIENT_ID>]` | Restore koshi shortcuts |
| `koshi toggle-lock [--client <CLIENT_ID>]` | Toggle locked input |

Successful create commands print what they made. `new-pane` and `run` print one
`[PANE ID]: pane-…` line. `new-tab` prints `[TAB ID]: tab-…`, then its root
`[PANE ID]: pane-…`.

### Shortcuts

Every one of these takes `--format table` (default) or `--format json`. They all
read the built-in shortcuts with your `keybinding.kdl` folded on top; nothing
here changes a shortcut, since the file is the only place they are set.

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `koshi keys list [--mode <MODE>] [--scope default\|user]` | The shortcuts actually in effect |
| `koshi keys describe "<KEY_SEQUENCE>"` | What a key sequence does and which file set it |
| `koshi keys conflicts` | Clashing shortcuts, ones that can never fire, and warnings |
| `koshi keys validate <PATH>` | Check a shortcut file without applying it |

### Actions

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `koshi actions list [--format table\|json]` | Everything you can bind, and where it applies |
| `koshi actions explain <ACTION> [--format table\|json]` | One action: where it applies, what it can aim at, examples |

### Updating

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `koshi update` | Check for a newer koshi and install it |
